# Prompt Folding for SillyTavern

An extension that groups prompts in the Prompt Manager into collapsible sections using simple header markers. Keeps your prompt list tidy and easier to navigate.

## Features

- Group prompts by adding a header marker at the beginning of a prompt name (e.g., `=Title`, `--- Utilities`).
- Each header becomes a collapsible section; items below it are grouped inside.
- Expand/Collapse all groups with one click.
- Enable/Disable grouping instantly.
- Customizable header markers and case sensitivity (persisted in localStorage).
- Supports two different folding modes (Standard and Sandwich).
- Lightweight and dependency-free. Styles provided by `collapsible-prompt.css`.

## Folding Modes

This extension supports two different folding modes, which can be selected in the settings panel.

- **Standard Mode (Default):** When a header is found, it will group all subsequent items under it until the next header is encountered.

- **Sandwich Mode:** This mode requires a pair of identical headers. It will group the opening header, the closing header, and all items in between into a single collapsible section.
  - *Example:*
    ```
    ==== Chapter 1 Start ====
    Prompt A
    Prompt B
    ==== Chapter 1 Start ====
    ```
    This will become a single foldable group titled `==== Chapter 1 Start ====`.

## Usage

- Create a prompt with a name that starts with one of your header markers.
- Depending on the selected mode, the grouping behavior will change.
- Click the buttons in the Prompt Manager header to Expand All, Collapse All, open Settings, or toggle grouping.
- Open Settings to configure header markers, folding mode, and case sensitivity.
